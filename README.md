# String Training


In this exercise we will put to work what you learned about string methods, as well as the following manipulations:

  - string multiplication(repetition)
  - slicing
  - joining


## Task 1: parse URL

**Parsing** is the art of breaking into parts and analyzing the structure of a complex entity.

In this task, you will write a function called 
```check_email(some_string)``` 
in which you are going to check if a string follows the rules for an acceptable email address for some made-up company:
  1. it must be composed of a "prefix" (see bellow) followed by the symbol "@" followed by a "suffix" (see below).
  2. the "prefix" must start with a letter and must contain only letters, numbers, or underscores and cannot be more than 10 characters long.
  3. the "suffix" must be : "fakecompany.com".

## Task 2

Create a function called ```str_stats(some_string)```
where given a random piece of text, it extracts and prints some statistics:

  - how many words
  - what percentage is capitalized
  - what percentage contains numbers or strange symbols
